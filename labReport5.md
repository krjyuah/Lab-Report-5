# Lab Report 5
I will pick my favorite lab report which is the lab report 3.

I think lab report 3 are contains so many important stuff, and I do learn a lot from that lab report. 
In lab report 3, we need to consider the commands **less**, **find**, and **grep**. 

First I focus on **find** and **grep**, then I need to compare the difference between **find** and **grep**
Since we learned about find, less and grep in week 4. Which I know that find and grep are similar, but still different.

**find** includes all of the directory names as well as the file names.

**grep** takes a string and a file, and prints out all the lines in that file that match the string.

For find, **find -name** and **find -type** are those good choice to do a web search.

* **find -name** is a specifies search based on the filename or pattern that follows.

* **find -type** is a specifies search based on the type of the file or directory that follows. 

I remember that I search online to found 4 interesting command-line options from grep in lab report 3.
Which is **grep -c**, **grep -r**, **grep -o**, **grep -n**

* **grep -c** is use to count print only a count of matching lines per file

when I work on grep -c, I open up some of the text files from berlitz1, to find a wrod which is appear some of the times in the textfiles. Then I found out "hotels", in HandRHawaii.txt, hotels appears 3 times.

* **grep -r** is use to recurse

I think it is a interesting command option, since I remeber that I use that on skill demos1. And this command option will recursive through the directories.

* **grep -o** is use to matching show only the part of a line matching PATTERN

When I try that, I discover that it is similar to grep -c, but the grep -c is only print out numbers, but grep -o will print out lines matching Pattern, which is interesting.

* **grep -n** is use to print line number with output lines.

I think this is the most useful command line I learn from this lab report. Since we can only type out a word, and the textfile, we can easy to find out which line of the files contains the word we want.
