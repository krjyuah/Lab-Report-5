# Lab Report 5
I will pick my favorite lab report which is the lab report 3.

I think lab report 3 are contains so many important stuff, and I do learn a lot from that lab report. 
In lab report 3, we need to consider the commands **less**, **find**, and **grep**. 
I remember that I use search online to found 4 interesting command-line options from grep in lab report 3.
Which is **grep -c**, **grep -r**, **grep -o**, **grep -n**

**grep -c** is use to count print only a count of matching lines per file

**grep -r** is use to recurse

**grep -o** is use to matching show only the part of a line matching PATTERN

**grep -n** is use to print line number with output lines.

Since we learned about find, less and grep in week 4. Which we know that find and grep are similar,
but grep can be more
