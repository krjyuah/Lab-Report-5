# Lab Report 5
I will pick my favorite lab report which is the lab report 3.

I think lab report 3 are contains so many important stuff, and I do learn a lot from that lab report. 
In lab report 3, we need to consider the commands **less**, **find**, and **grep**. 

Since we learned about find, less and grep in week 4. Which we know that find and grep are similar, but still different.

**find** includes all of the directory names as well as the file names.

**grep** takes a string and a file, and prints out all the lines in that file that match the string.

For find, **find -name** and **find -type** are those good choice to do a web search.

* **find -name** is a specifies search based on the filename or pattern that follows.

* **find -type** is a specifies search based on the type of the file or directory that follows. 

I remember that I search online to found 4 interesting command-line options from grep in lab report 3.
Which is **grep -c**, **grep -r**, **grep -o**, **grep -n**

* **grep -c** is use to count print only a count of matching lines per file

* **grep -r** is use to recurse

* **grep -o** is use to matching show only the part of a line matching PATTERN

* **grep -n** is use to print line number with output lines.

Even that grep and find are similar, we need to use different command line in different situation.
